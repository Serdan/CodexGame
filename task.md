# Progress

## Completed
- Initialized .NET solution and projects
- Implemented core classes: Chunk, MeshData, MeshBuilder, GameEngine
- Created console sample game in VoxelGame
- Wrote unit tests for Chunk and MeshBuilder
- Configured Coverlet for code coverage
- Added Stryker mutation testing config
- Added README.md
- Integrated OpenTK for real-time 3D rendering

## To Do
- Implement camera controls and input handling
- Implement greedy meshing for performance
- Implement lighting (ambient occlusion / directional lighting)
- Add save/load functionality for world data
- Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- Improve documentation (XML comments, tutorials)

# Tasks

- Create a voxel engine (core functionality: chunks, mesh building, world management).
- Create a sample game using voxels (console-based & real-time 3D with OpenTK/MonoGame).
- Add more features as listed in progress section.

# Tech

- Dotnet
- Any code-first game engine for dotnet.
- Coverlet
- Stryker
- Git. Use commits as appropriate.
- Add to list as needed.

# C# style rules
